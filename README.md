## Hardware Setup
This example uses the kit’s default configuration. See the respective kit guide to ensure that the kit is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ships with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the Firmware Loader GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup
To the view battery level in Battery Service, download and install the CySmart™ app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cysmart/id928939093?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cypress.cysmart&hl=en).

You can also use the [CySmart Host Emulation Tool](http://www.cypress.com/go/cysmart) Windows PC application if you have access to the [CY5677 CySmart BLE 4.2 USB Dongle](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy5677-cysmart-bluetooth-low-energy-ble-42-usb-dongle).

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. 
   
   To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox** > **Library Manager**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example.

4. Optionally, update the **Application Name** and **Location** fields with the application name and local path where the application is created.

5. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

   For more details, see the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run *Cygwin.bat*.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the [CLI](#in-command-line-interface-cli) section to download or clone the repository, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.


## Operation
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use your favorite serial terminal application and connect to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings.

   Baud rate: 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity: None; Stop: 1 bit; Flow control: None; New line for receive data: Line Feed(LF) or Auto setting
 
 3. Program the board.
 
   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox**:

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.


   - **Using CLI**:

      From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:

      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:

      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
      
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

     After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make all the required connections.

4.	To test using the CySmart mobile app:

    1. Turn ON Bluetooth on your Android or iOS device.

    2. Launch the CySmart app.

    3. Press the reset switch on the kit to start BLE advertisements. The red LED (LED1) starts blinking to indicate that advertising has started. Advertising will stop after 120 seconds if a connection has not been established.

    4. Swipe down on the CySmart app home screen to start scanning for BLE Peripherals; your device appears in the CySmart app home screen. Select your device to establish a BLE connection (see Figure 1). Once the connection is established, the user LED turns to always ON state.

        **Figure 1. CySmart App Device Discovery**
        ![Figure 1](images/figure1.png)


    5. Select Battery Service (see Figure 2) from the carousel view to check the Battery levels. Tap **Start Notify** to get notification of changing battery level as shown in Figure 3.

        **Figure 2. CySmart App Battery Service**
        ![Figure 2](images/figure2.png)

        **Figure 3. Battery Level**
        ![Figure 3](images/figure3.png)


5.  Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth stack and application trace messages in the terminal window.

    **Figure 4. Log Messages on KitProg3 COM Port**
    ![Figure 4](images/figure4.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and Implementation
The code example implements a BLE GATT Server for Battery Service.

The battery service is used to simulate the battery level, which changes continuously from 100 to 0 percent in steps of 2 percent. On a periodic timer, the notification is sent to client.


## Resources and Settings
This section explains the ModusToolbox resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example. ModusToolbox stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the graphical configurators, which generate the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

- **Device Configurator:** The Device Configurator is used to enable/configure the peripherals and the pins used in the application. For detailed information on how to use it, see the
[Device Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth Configurator:** The Bluetooth Configurator is used for generating/modifying the BLE GATT database. For detailed information on how to use it, see the
[Bluetooth Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).
